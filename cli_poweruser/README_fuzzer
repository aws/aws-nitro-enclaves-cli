===== Stronghold Device Fuzzer =====

All prerequisites handling is done by run_fuzzer.sh.
The script should be run from inside a cloud desktop environment
and it will do the following:
  * launch an ec2 instance with enclaves support
  * download the fuzzer source code from s3, inside the instance
  * install the required packages and set the correct rust version
  * start the fuzzer

The fuzzer output will be available inside a file called
'nohup.out', located under the cli_poweruser/ directory,
inside de nitro-cli repository.
