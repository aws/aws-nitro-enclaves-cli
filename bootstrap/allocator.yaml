# Enclave configuration file.
#
# How much memory to allocate for enclaves (in MiB).
memory_mib: 512
#
# How many CPUs to reserve for enclaves.
cpu_count: 2
#
# Alternatively, the exact CPUs to be reserved for the enclave can be explicitly
# configured by using `cpu_pool` (like below), instead of `cpu_count`.
# Note: cpu_count and cpu_pool conflict with each other. Only use exactly one of them.
# Example of reserving CPUs 2, 3, and 6 through 9:
# cpu_pool: 2,3,6-9
#
# Allocator configuration for multiple enclaves
# Each list item represents a separate enclave
# Use YAML array like the example below.
# Example:
# - memory_mib: 512
#   cpu_count: 2
# - memory_mib: 512
#   cpu_pool: 2,3,6-9
# You can add more enclave configurations as needed.
# Allocated Resources are not tied with enclaves.
# It's a mechanism to separate resources from each other.
