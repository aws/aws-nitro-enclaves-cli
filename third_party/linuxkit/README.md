#LinuxKit

## Usage
LinuxKit is used for building an enclave image format (EIF) image with a consistent checksum.

It is present in the [x86_64 blobs](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/blob/main/blobs/x86_64) and [aarch64 blobs](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/blob/main/blobs/aarch64) directories, as a
pre-built binary, based on [linuxkit v0.8](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/releases/tag/v0.8).
