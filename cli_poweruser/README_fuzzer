===== Stronghold Device Fuzzer =====

Prerequisite: install all the components required for building the CLI by
running
```
./install_cargo_deps.sh
```

The fuzzer uses a sample EIF which can be downloaded from
https://drive.corp.amazon.com/documents/bercarug@/command_executer.eif
It must be scp'ed on the instance the fuzzer will run on, inside the
cli_poweruser/ directory of the repository.

In order to start the fuzzer, run (as normal user)
```
./run_fuzzer.sh
```

The fuzzer output will be available in a file called `nohup.out`, inside the
same cli_poweruser/ directory.
